# TestProject
Unfortunately, in this day and age, your GitHub activity has become more and more a source of information for your coding ability.  While I spend most of the day coding without Git, this project will create some activity on this project on a daily basis designed to make the activity chart in my GitHub profile more impressive.  This uses PowerShell and a Windows Task Scheduler to make some project activity on a daily basis.
